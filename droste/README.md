# Droste

Run JavaScript and Lua code on Python, or the other way round,
through [JSPyBridge], [Pythonia], and [Lupa].


## About

## Synopsis

## Details

The glue-code implementations in Droste originated from needs at [mqttwarn] and
[Node-BLUE].

[import-maps] let's you control the behavior of JavaScript imports. Node-BLUE uses
[@node-loader/import-maps], in order to work around a few problems.

> A nodejs loader for import maps. This allows you to customize module resolution by
> creating a `node.importmap` file.



## Etymology

> The Droste effect (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈdrɔstə]), known in art as an example of
> mise en abyme, is the effect of a picture recursively appearing within itself, in
> a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear. This
> produces a loop which in theory could go on forever, but in practice only continues
> as far as the image's resolution allows.
